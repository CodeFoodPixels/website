        &lt;p&gt;While GitHub pages supports HTTPS for sites using the github.io domain, it doesn’t support it for custom domains. I’ve had a few people ask how I’ve achieved HTTPS with a custom domain on GitHub pages, so I felt I should write a post on it.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;2017 has been a good year for me with some successful projects and some personal firsts. I felt I should do a little retrospective on this stuff, partially so I can come back and look at it in the future, partially as a celebration. It’s not in any particular order.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A really useful feature that I often find myself using in Chrome DevTools is conditional breakpoints. Conditional breakponts allow you to only pause execution when a certain expression evaluates to true, meaning that you can pause it when you want it to.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My previous site hadn’t been touched since late 2014 and was running using a custom PHP system I’d written that took markdown and produced the page. This was happening every time someone hit the page so was pretty inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my focus is no longer on PHP, I wanted to move towards something JavaScript based. I didn’t want to use a client side framework to do this, as the content is pretty static and I feel it would be needless to require JavaScript to present static content.&lt;/p&gt;
