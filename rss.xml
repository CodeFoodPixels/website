        &lt;p&gt;A really useful feature that I often find myself using in Chrome DevTools is conditional breakpoints. Conditional breakponts allow you to only pause execution when a certain expression evaluates to true, meaning that you can pause it when you want it to.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My previous site hadn’t been touched since late 2014 and was running using a custom PHP system I’d written that took markdown and produced the page. This was happening every time someone hit the page so was pretty inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my focus is no longer on PHP, I wanted to move towards something JavaScript based. I didn’t want to use a client side framework to do this, as the content is pretty static and I feel it would be needless to require JavaScript to present static content.&lt;/p&gt;
