The event was awesome and I'm so happy that I got to be part of such an excellent lineup and meet so many great people. Also Budapest is a beautiful city, I need to go back.\n\nI was also asked to speak at the Leeds Testing Atelier, a community-run testing conference, where I spoke about snapshot testing ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfydKkSAuc)). Again, this was a great experience!\n\nRounding out my speaking this year, I was asked at short notice to speak GDG Devfest Coimbra. I jumped at the opportunity to speak again and was glad that I did! The event was a mix of web, Android and a few other things, all really interesting! Again I got to meet some fantastic people and have some great conversations. I didn't get to spend a lot of time in Portugal, but I definitely want to go back.\n\nI'm really fortunate that my manager has been super supportive as I've been doing this, allowing me to take the time off work without having to use holiday as well as giving some great feedback. My friends and co-workers have been really supportive too.\n\n## LeedsJS\n\nLeedsJS is the JavaScript community group that I run in Leeds and this has been our best year so far!\n\nTowards the end of 2016 we tried having 2 talks per event and I felt it worked so well that this year we carried on with it!\n\nWe've had great talks on JavaScript topics such as React, Swagger and PWAs as well as some more human topics such as mental health and continuous delivery.\n\nWe also became an alcohol-free event as well as trying to get some more inclusive food choices (such as vegan and gluten free options). I've noticed that our attendees are a bit more diverse as a result, which is what I was aiming for!\n\n## Work\n\nI've been at Sky Betting & Gaming for 18 months now and it's flown by. I'm extremely fortunate to be working with a great team.\n\nI've learned a lot over the past year and being allowed the time to learn stuff while working has been fantastic. As a result, I finally did some work with React this year. Having the opportunity to mentor has been amazing too!\n\nA huge milestone was releasing the responsive site to 100% of customers. My team has been working on this the entire time that I've worked there, taking an experimental approach to make sure we got it right. I'm super proud of the work we've done.\n\n## Personal Projects\n\nEarlier in this year I released [jscad-includify](https://github.com/lukeb-uk/jscad-includify) which is a Node module that builds the includes for a [JSCAD](https://openjscad.org/) project into one file. This was a great opportunity to learn more about ASTs as well as having a go at building a utility that works as both a cli tool and a Node module.\n\nAs a result of the work I did on jscad-includify, I got interested in snapshot testing. As I couldn't find a tool that would let me do snapshot testing with TAP (the Node test framework that I like), I ended up writing [tapshot](https://github.com/lukeb-uk/tapshot). This was an interesting challenge as I learned a lot about snapshot testing and had to ensure it was well tested itself.\n\nI also rebuilt this website with the aim of keeping it more up to date and to blog more. You can read more about the website [here](https://lukeb.co.uk/2017/11/12/New-Website/).\n\nThroughout the year I've also been working on my automation bot [Woodhouse](https://github.com/Woodhouse). I've not added a lot of major functionality and have mainly been working on tidying up the version 2 code, but I have been working on automating my heating over the past couple of months and will hopefully have a post up on that soon.\n\n## Mental Health\n\nThis year I've been far more aware of and open about my mental health.\n\nI've taken 2 separate weeks to clean and declutter my house. During this time I cleared a load of junk out of my house, cleaned, donated a load of stuff to charity and set up a work area so that I can build stuff. This was with the aim of making my house a place I feel more at home in and somewhere I can feel comfortable.\n\nA co-worker and I also pitched for Mind to be Sky Betting & Gaming's charity of the year for 2018. The winner will be announced early next year so fingers crossed that we win!\n\n## 2018 Aims\n\nI have no real concrete aims for 2018, but I have a few rough ideas:\n\n- More public speaking - I've really enjoyed giving talks and want to do it more. I've got a plan for my next talk and will be starting work soon!\n- More blogging - I want to try and share as much information as I can, as well as increasing my written communication skills.\n- More learning\n- More open source projects\n","source":"_posts/2017-Retrospective.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 2017 Retrospective\ndate: 2017-12-24 12:00:00\ntags:\n - retrospective\n---\n2017 has been a good year for me with some successful projects and some personal firsts.

This was a great opportunity to learn more about ASTs as well as having a go at building a utility that works as both a cli tool and a Node module.\n\nAs a result of the work I did on jscad-includify, I got interested in snapshot testing. As I couldn't find a tool that would let me do snapshot testing with TAP (the Node test framework that I like), I ended up writing [tapshot](https://github.com/lukeb-uk/tapshot). This was an interesting challenge as I learned a lot about snapshot testing and had to ensure it was well tested itself.\n\nI also rebuilt this website with the aim of keeping it more up to date and to blog more. You can read more about the website [here](https://lukeb.co.uk/2017/11/12/New-Website/).\n\nThroughout the year I've also been working on my automation bot [Woodhouse](https://github.com/Woodhouse). I've not added a lot of major functionality and have mainly been working on tidying up the version 2 code, but I have been working on automating my heating over the past couple of months and will hopefully have a post up on that soon.\n\n## Mental Health\n\nThis year I've been far more aware of and open about my mental health.\n\nI've taken 2 separate weeks to clean and declutter my house. During this time I cleared a load of junk out of my house, cleaned, donated a load of stuff to charity and set up a work area so that I can build stuff. This was with the aim of making my house a place I feel more at home in and somewhere I can feel comfortable.\n\nA co-worker and I also pitched for Mind to be Sky Betting & Gaming's charity of the year for 2018. The winner will be announced early next year so fingers crossed that we win!\n\n## 2018 Aims\n\nI have no real concrete aims for 2018, but I have a few rough ideas:\n\n- More public speaking - I've really enjoyed giving talks and want to do it more. I've got a plan for my next talk and will be starting work soon!\n- More blogging - I want to try and share as much information as I can, as well as increasing my written communication skills.\n- More learning\n- More open source projects\n","slug":"2017-Retrospective","published":1,"updated":"2018-04-27T09:13:33.925Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjghqq7vu0000q8w88jydu60f","content":"<p>2017 has been a good year for me with some successful projects and some personal firsts.

We've tried a couple of ways to give them away and I thought I'd write up a post to discuss them.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Where to get prizes\nI guess this should be the first step, because you need to have stuff to be able to give away stuff. I know of a few ways to do this:\n\n1) Ask companies to give you stuff. When I first got involved in LeedsJS I reached out through Twitter to one of the developer advocates at Google and after a few emails I had some Google merchandise to give away.\n\n2) Company sponsorship schemes. A few companies have proper schemes where they'll give merchandise or their products away to community groups. A couple of examples are [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/support/#section=communities) and [GitHub](https://community.github.com/).\n\n3) Get sponsors to buy you stuff. If there are companies interested in sponsoring your events, an alternative to getting them to buy the food or drinks is to ask them to buy some prizes. This could be books, subscription codes or software licenses, but that's something to discuss with the sponsor.\n\n4) Conferences will sometimes give you a ticket to give away in return for a bit of promotion, so it may be worth asking. They will also sometimes have a discount code that you can make available to your members.\n\n## Ways to give your stuff away\nWith LeedsJS we've tried a couple of ways to give our prizes away.\n\n### Challenges\nOriginally we started setting challenges around the main talk, so if we had a talk about Angular then the challenge would be to build something with Angular.\n\nWe'd get a couple of entries around some of the more interesting topics, but usually struggled to get anybody to enter. Ultimately we gave up with challenges because of this.\n\nI do think this is a strong idea, but I think it would be better suited to framework or library specific groups because a lot of the topics will be based on the foundation of that framework or library whereas LeedsJS covers JavaScript in general.\n\n### Prize draws\n\nThe current way that we're doing our giveaways at LeedsJS is through a prize draw. As part of the introduction to the event, I have a slide with a link to a Google form for attendees to fill out. At the end of the event I then run a script attached to the form that will pick a random entrant as the winner.\n\nIf you feel like this is the right approach for your group, then I have a template form that you can use to get started. The form has the script attached to it already, so all you have to do is make a copy, customise it to suit your giveaway and then share it. When you come to select your winner, click on the puzzle piece in the top right, select \"Choose random responder\". You'll need to auth with your Google account so that it can read the data. You can get the form from [this Google folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LGGcDjoS8_yWZbQU9blBz9AdTJX9z4Gq).\n\nCurrently this form only asks for the entrant's name, but after a discussion with my friend and former co-organiser [Chris Manson](https://twitter.com/real_ate) I may update the one for LeedsJS to ask for some feedback about the event/group too.\n\n## Please let me know how it goes!\nIf you try any of this out with your group or have other ideas/suggestions to add to this post, please [tweet or DM me](https://twitter.com/LukeB_UK/).

I've had a few people ask how I've achieved HTTPS with a custom domain on GitHub pages, so I felt I should write a post on it.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Setting Up GitHub Pages\n\nThe first thing we have to do is configure the repo on GitHub.\n\n1. Open the \"settings\" page on your repo and scroll down to the \"GitHub Pages\" section\n\n2. Select the source that your GitHub pages site will be built from. There are a few options here:\n    - gh-pages branch - This means you can use a separate branch on your project just for your documentation.\n\n    - master branch - This means that the content of your master branch is used. I use this for this website.\n\n    - master branch /docs folder - This uses the contents of a \"docs\" folder in the root of your master branch for the site content.\n\n    - None - This disables GitHub pages for the repo.\n\n3. Set your custom domain in the \"Custom domain\" section\n\n**Note:** The \"Enforce HTTPS\" box gets disabled when you add a custom domain. This is fine as we'll be enforcing HTTPS in the next section.\n\n## Adding HTTPS with Cloudflare\n\nTo add HTTPS to our GitHub pages custom domain we'll be using the free tier of [Cloudfare](https://www.cloudflare.com).\n\n### Adding The DNS Records\n\nDuring the process of adding your site, you'll be shown a list of DNS records for your domain. Alternatively you can go to the \"DNS\" section of the dashboard.\n\nYou need to add `CNAME` record for `www` that redirects to your GitHub pages URL. For me that means I have it set to `lukeb-uk.github.io`. Make sure that the traffic is set to go through Cloudflare with the orange cloud.\n\nYou could also add your root domain instead of `www` and this would mean it redirects to GitHub pages when you hit the root domain. This is how I have it set up.\n\n### Enabling HTTPS\n\nOn the dashboard, go to the \"Crypto\" section. In the SSL section you should select \"Full\" and **not** \"Full (strict)\".\n\nFurther down the page there's a setting for \"Always use HTTPS\". Set this to \"On\". This means that any HTTP connections will get forced to HTTPS.\n\nYou now have a site hosted on GitHub Pages that uses a custom domain and HTTPS!\n\n## Cloudflare Caching\n\nCloudflare also has a CDN (content delivery network) allowing optimised delivery of content to your visitors. By default HTML content isn't cached, but you can add a page rule to do this.\n\nIn the \"Page Rules\" section of the dashboard, create a page rule. In the URL box, put your domain followed by an asterisk. For me that would be `https://lukeb.co.uk/*`. Then in the settings section, select \"Cache Level\" from the drop down and then set the cache level to \"Cache Everything\". Save and deploy this rule.\n\nYou can also enable Cloudflare's Always Online™ feature that will serve your site's static pages from their cache if GitHub has an outage. You can enable this in the \"Caching\" section of the dashboard.\n","source":"_posts/HTTPS-With-A-Custom-Domain-On-GitHub-Pages.md","raw":"---\ntitle: HTTPS With A Custom Domain On GitHub Pages\ndate: 2018-01-02 10:00:00\ntags:\n - tips\n - GitHub pages\n - Cloudflare\n---\nWhile GitHub pages supports HTTPS for sites using the github.io domain, it doesn't support it for custom domains.

This is fine as we’ll be enforcing HTTPS in the next section.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Adding-HTTPS-with-Cloudflare\"><a href=\"#Adding-HTTPS-with-Cloudflare\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Adding HTTPS with Cloudflare\"></a>Adding HTTPS with Cloudflare</h2><p>To add HTTPS to our GitHub pages custom domain we’ll be using the free tier of <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Cloudfare</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Adding-The-DNS-Records\"><a href=\"#Adding-The-DNS-Records\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Adding The DNS Records\"></a>Adding The DNS Records</h3><p>During the process of adding your site, you’ll be shown a list of DNS records for your domain. Alternatively you can go to the “DNS” section of the dashboard.</p>\n<p>You need to add <code>CNAME</code> record for <code>www</code> that redirects to your GitHub pages URL. For me that means I have it set to <code>lukeb-uk.github.io</code>. Make sure that the traffic is set to go through Cloudflare with the orange cloud.</p>\n<p>You could also add your root domain instead of <code>www</code> and this would mean it redirects to GitHub pages when you hit the root domain. This is how I have it set up.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Enabling-HTTPS\"><a href=\"#Enabling-HTTPS\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Enabling HTTPS\"></a>Enabling HTTPS</h3><p>On the dashboard, go to the “Crypto” section. In the SSL section you should select “Full” and <strong>not</strong> “Full (strict)”.</p>\n<p>Further down the page there’s a setting for “Always use HTTPS”. Set this to “On”. This means that any HTTP connections will get forced to HTTPS.</p>\n<p>You now have a site hosted on GitHub Pages that uses a custom domain and HTTPS!</p>\n<h2 id=\"Cloudflare-Caching\"><a href=\"#Cloudflare-Caching\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Cloudflare Caching\"></a>Cloudflare Caching</h2><p>Cloudflare also has a CDN (content delivery network) allowing optimised delivery of content to your visitors. By default HTML content isn’t cached, but you can add a page rule to do this.</p>\n<p>In the “Page Rules” section of the dashboard, create a page rule. In the URL box, put your domain followed by an asterisk. For me that would be <code>https://lukeb.co.uk/*</code>. Then in the settings section, select “Cache Level” from the drop down and then set the cache level to “Cache Everything”. Save and deploy this rule.</p>\n<p>You can also enable Cloudflare’s Always Online™ feature that will serve your site’s static pages from their cache if GitHub has an outage. You can enable this in the “Caching” section of the dashboard.</p>"},{"title":"Learning About Burnout By Crashing My Car","date":"2018-01-15T22:25:00.000Z","_content":"Today marks 4 years since I crashed and wrote off my car while driving to work one morning due to being burnt out.

There were a variety of reasons as to why I felt that this would be the best route, and it seems to have been a success!\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Previous experiences\n\nBefore April's event, we'd always had Q&A after the talks. Over the 3 years that I've been involved in LeedsJS, I've experienced a few reoccurring issues with the Q&A part of the talks.\n\n### The question designed to show off how much the asker knows\n\nThis is one of my least favourite things I've had happen. Someone asks a question but puts it in a way that is intended to try and show that the asker knows more about the topic than the speaker.\n\nThis really sucks because the speaker has just given up a huge chunk of their time to share their knowledge and teach others. The asker has not and is basically stroking their own ego.\n\n### \"I have this specific problem with my code, fix it for me\"\n\nThis is another one I really hate. The asker in this instance is basically asking the speaker to do work for them for free, on top of the work they had to do to prepare and deliver the talk.\n\nWhat makes this worse for me is that it's likely that the asker came to the event with this question in mind, planning to ask the speaker to do this free work.\n\nIt's also disrespectful to the audience, they don't care about your specific code issues and they have no context for them anyway.\n\n### \"More of a statement than a question, but...\"\n\nI feel this is another example of the asker stroking their own ego. Rather than ask a question, the \"asker\" makes a statement, usually trying to correct something the speaker said or giving their opinion. To me this is hugely disrespectful, especially considering the time and effort that the speaker has put in.\n\n### The question that's largely irrelevant to the talk\n\nThis usually happens when someone focuses on a small aspect of the talk that wasn't really relevant to the central point. It may be of interest to the asker but isn't related to what the speaker wanted people to take away from the talk or even something that the speaker has an opinion about.\n\n### The joke question\n\nWhile most people like a joke, unfortunately people aren't very original when it comes to thinking one up. Often when there's a joke question about a talk, the speaker has heard it multiple times already. To them, the humour has likely worn off and become tedious, especially if it's something related to them and not the talk.\n\n### A decent chunk of the audience probably doesn't care\n\nWhile there can still be good questions in a Q&A, it's still usually something that only a handful of your audience actually wants to know more about. The rest of your audience is becoming disengaged and just wants your event to progress. [The question that's largely irrelevant to the talk](#The-question-that's-largely-irrelevant-to-the-talk) and the [\"I have this specific problem with my code, fix it for me\"](#“I-have-this-specific-problem-with-my-code-fix-it-for-me”) also fall into this category.\n\n## Additional factors\n\nOn top of the things I've seen happen before at LeedsJS, there are some things that I also see as areas where Q&A falls down or can be an issue. This stuff is either from my own experience as an organiser/speaker/attendee or what I've learned from others through discussions.\n\n### The speaker is put on the spot\n\nFor some folks, being put on the spot to answer something that they've not been able to prepare for is anxiety-inducing and something that they want to avoid.\n\nYou may argue \"you're expected to know this stuff\" but I disagree, talks aren't only for experts. They're for sharing experiences and ideas, for inspiring folks to try something and for encouraging people to learn too. It's fine to not know the answer to a question, but being asked to admit this on stage in front of an audience is likely something that people want to avoid.\n\nSimilarly, you may argue \"you can't prepare for everything in life\", but giving a talk is an already stressful situation that someone has spent a lot of time on preparation for. Adding a wildcard element into that is unnecessary extra stress.\n\n### Asking questions can be daunting\n\nAfter publishing this post, [Nic on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NicolaClareFox/status/993107406879064064) mentioned that some folks don't like asking questions in front of a room full of people. This is an aspect that I'd forgotten to mention but one that I've experienced myself.\n\nPublic speaking is one of the most common fears that people have and in this situation asking a question is public speaking. This means that many people won't want to ask a question, no matter how much they want to know the answer. It can also mean that people can leave the talk feeling frustrated and confused, which is the opposite of what a speaker wants.\n\n### Conversations are more meaningful\n\nIn my experience, the questions asked usually need some sort of back and forth to get an answer that both sides are happy with. This is really difficult to do when the speaker is on stage or at the front of the room and the asker is amongst a sea of faces.\n\nHaving a conversation allows the speaker and asker to be on the same page and get an answer that they're both happy with. On top of this, the speaker can ask other people questions when in a conversation situation, meaning that everyone can learn something.\n\n### It drags down the end of the talk\n\nOften when a speaker ends their talk, they end it with something like a point that they want the audience to think about or with a big finish to wow the audience. The mood is then brought down by the Q&A and usually ends at the lowest point of lingering silence to see if there are any more questions.\n\n## What we're doing instead\n\nAt LeedsJS we have 2 talks split by a 20 minute break. Instead of Q&A, I encourage people to come and chat with the speaker after the talk. This means that only those who are interested in learning more can be part of the conversation instead of everyone being forced into it.\n\nDuring this time I make sure I'm around the speaker for support and so that I can step in if someone is being rude or if there's an issue.\n\nThe conversations after the talks at the April event were great, the speaker and attendees all seemed to be enjoying the conversations. There seemed to be a lot of back and forth and there was some great discussion about parts of the talk or things related to it.\n\nI've declared the trial at April's event a success. Q&A is not coming back to LeedsJS.\n\n## What prompted this?\n\nThis has been something that's been in my head for a while, but a few things recently brought it to the front of my mind.\n\nFirstly, I was picked to speak at [ScotlandJS 2018](http://scotlandjs.com/), which has something they call the \"discussion track\". After every 3 talks, there's a 20 minute break where the speakers from those talks will be in an advertised location for people to come and chat with them.\n\nI also attended the JSHeroes conference the week before April's LeedsJS event. While the conference was great and the organisers tried to make the Q&A section as engaging as possible, it still suffered many of the issues I've mentioned in this post. This is not the fault of the organisers, the work they did was fantastic!\n\nAnother thing was that Kitze shared his \"[awesome conference practices](https://github.com/kitze/awesome-conference-practices)\" document. There was some healthy discussion about Q&A as part of that and I realised that other people shared my views on Q&A.\n\n","source":"_posts/Why-LeedsJS-Doesn-t-Have-Q-A-Anymore.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Why LeedsJS Doesn't Have Q&A Anymore\ndate: 2018-05-06 12:30:00\ntags:\n - community\n - meetups\n - speaking\n---\nThe day before April's LeedsJS meetup, I decided to try not having Q&A after the talks in favour of encouraging people to come and chat to the speakers directly.

To me this is hugely disrespectful, especially considering the time and effort that the speaker has put in.</p>\n<h3 id=\"The-question-that’s-largely-irrelevant-to-the-talk\"><a href=\"#The-question-that’s-largely-irrelevant-to-the-talk\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The question that’s largely irrelevant to the talk\"></a>The question that’s largely irrelevant to the talk</h3><p>This usually happens when someone focuses on a small aspect of the talk that wasn’t really relevant to the central point. It may be of interest to the asker but isn’t related to what the speaker wanted people to take away from the talk or even something that the speaker has an opinion about.</p>\n<h3 id=\"The-joke-question\"><a href=\"#The-joke-question\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The joke question\"></a>The joke question</h3><p>While most people like a joke, unfortunately people aren’t very original when it comes to thinking one up. Often when there’s a joke question about a talk, the speaker has heard it multiple times already. To them, the humour has likely worn off and become tedious, especially if it’s something related to them and not the talk.</p>\n<h3 id=\"A-decent-chunk-of-the-audience-probably-doesn’t-care\"><a href=\"#A-decent-chunk-of-the-audience-probably-doesn’t-care\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"A decent chunk of the audience probably doesn’t care\"></a>A decent chunk of the audience probably doesn’t care</h3><p>While there can still be good questions in a Q&amp;A, it’s still usually something that only a handful of your audience actually wants to know more about. The rest of your audience is becoming disengaged and just wants your event to progress. <a href=\"#The-question-that&#39;s-largely-irrelevant-to-the-talk\">The question that’s largely irrelevant to the talk</a> and the <a href=\"#“I-have-this-specific-problem-with-my-code-fix-it-for-me”\">“I have this specific problem with my code, fix it for me”</a> also fall into this category.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Additional-factors\"><a href=\"#Additional-factors\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Additional factors\"></a>Additional factors</h2><p>On top of the things I’ve seen happen before at LeedsJS, there are some things that I also see as areas where Q&amp;A falls down or can be an issue. This stuff is either from my own experience as an organiser/speaker/attendee or what I’ve learned from others through discussions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"The-speaker-is-put-on-the-spot\"><a href=\"#The-speaker-is-put-on-the-spot\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The speaker is put on the spot\"></a>The speaker is put on the spot</h3><p>For some folks, being put on the spot to answer something that they’ve not been able to prepare for is anxiety-inducing and something that they want to avoid.</p>\n<p>You may argue “you’re expected to know this stuff” but I disagree, talks aren’t only for experts. They’re for sharing experiences and ideas, for inspiring folks to try something and for encouraging people to learn too. It’s fine to not know the answer to a question, but being asked to admit this on stage in front of an audience is likely something that people want to avoid.</p>\n<p>Similarly, you may argue “you can’t prepare for everything in life”, but giving a talk is an already stressful situation that someone has spent a lot of time on preparation for. Adding a wildcard element into that is unnecessary extra stress.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Asking-questions-can-be-daunting\"><a href=\"#Asking-questions-can-be-daunting\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Asking questions can be daunting\"></a>Asking questions can be daunting</h3><p>After publishing this post, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NicolaClareFox/status/993107406879064064\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Nic on Twitter</a> mentioned that some folks don’t like asking questions in front of a room full of people. This is an aspect that I’d forgotten to mention but one that I’ve experienced myself.</p>\n<p>Public speaking is one of the most common fears that people have and in this situation asking a question is public speaking. This means that many people won’t want to ask a question, no matter how much they want to know the answer. It can also mean that people can leave the talk feeling frustrated and confused, which is the opposite of what a speaker wants.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Conversations-are-more-meaningful\"><a href=\"#Conversations-are-more-meaningful\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Conversations are more meaningful\"></a>Conversations are more meaningful</h3><p>In my experience, the questions asked usually need some sort of back and forth to get an answer that both sides are happy with. This is really difficult to do when the speaker is on stage or at the front of the room and the asker is amongst a sea of faces.</p>\n<p>Having a conversation allows the speaker and asker to be on the same page and get an answer that they’re both happy with. On top of this, the speaker can ask other people questions when in a conversation situation, meaning that everyone can learn something.</p>\n<h3 id=\"It-drags-down-the-end-of-the-talk\"><a href=\"#It-drags-down-the-end-of-the-talk\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"It drags down the end of the talk\"></a>It drags down the end of the talk</h3><p>Often when a speaker ends their talk, they end it with something like a point that they want the audience to think about or with a big finish to wow the audience. The mood is then brought down by the Q&amp;A and usually ends at the lowest point of lingering silence to see if there are any more questions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"What-we’re-doing-instead\"><a href=\"#What-we’re-doing-instead\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What we’re doing instead\"></a>What we’re doing instead</h2><p>At LeedsJS we have 2 talks split by a 20 minute break. Instead of Q&amp;A, I encourage people to come and chat with the speaker after the talk. This means that only those who are interested in learning more can be part of the conversation instead of everyone being forced into it.</p>\n<p>During this time I make sure I’m around the speaker for support and so that I can step in if someone is being rude or if there’s an issue.</p>\n<p>The conversations after the talks at the April event were great, the speaker and attendees all seemed to be enjoying the conversations. There seemed to be a lot of back and forth and there was some great discussion about parts of the talk or things related to it.</p>\n<p>I’ve declared the trial at April’s event a success. Q&amp;A is not coming back to LeedsJS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"What-prompted-this\"><a href=\"#What-prompted-this\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What prompted this?\"></a>What prompted this?</h2><p>This has been something that’s been in my head for a while, but a few things recently brought it to the front of my mind.</p>\n<p>Firstly, I was picked to speak at <a href=\"http://scotlandjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">ScotlandJS 2018</a>, which has something they call the “discussion track”. After every 3 talks, there’s a 20 minute break where the speakers from those talks will be in an advertised location for people to come and chat with them.</p>\n<p>I also attended the JSHeroes conference the week before April’s LeedsJS event. While the conference was great and the organisers tried to make the Q&amp;A section as engaging as possible, it still suffered many of the issues I’ve mentioned in this post. This is not the fault of the organisers, the work they did was fantastic!</p>\n<p>Another thing was that Kitze shared his “<a href=\"https://github.com/kitze/awesome-conference-practices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">awesome conference practices</a>“ document. There was some healthy discussion about Q&amp;A as part of that and I realised that other people shared my views on Q&amp;A.</p>"}],"PostAsset":[{"_id":"source/_posts/Blackboxing-Scripts-In-Chrome-DevTools/call-stack-pane.png","slug":"call-stack-pane.png","post":"cjghqq7w10002q8w8vixr69oj","modified":0,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_posts/Blackboxing-Scripts-In-Chrome-DevTools/editor-pane.png","slug":"editor-pane.png","post":"cjghqq7w10002q8w8vixr69oj","modified":0,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_posts/Blackboxing-Scripts-In-Chrome-DevTools/settings.png","slug":"settings.png","post":"cjghqq7w10002q8w8vixr69oj","modified":0,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_posts/Conditional-Breakpoints-Chrome-DevTools/breakpoint-condition.png","slug":"breakpoint-condition.png","post":"cjghqq7wa0006q8w8owf59kwh","modified":0,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_posts/Conditional-Breakpoints-Chrome-DevTools/breakpoint-console-log.png","slug":"breakpoint-console-log.png","post":"cjghqq7wa0006q8w8owf59kwh","modified":0,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_posts/Conditional-Breakpoints-Chrome-DevTools/breakpoint-context-menu.png","slug":"breakpoint-context-menu.png","post":"cjghqq7wa0006q8w8owf59kwh","modified":0,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_posts/Conditional-Breakpoints-Chrome-DevTools/breakpoint-fired.png","slug":"breakpoint-fired.png","post":"cjghqq7wa0006q8w8owf59kwh","modified":0,"renderable":0}],"PostCategory":[],"PostTag":[{"post_id":"cjghqq7vu0000q8w88jydu60f","tag_id":"cjghqq7w40004q8w8dl55miu2","_id":"cjghqq7wd0009q8w8v0qziyj6"},{"post_id":"cjghqq7w10002q8w8vixr69oj","tag_id":"cjghqq7wd0008q8w8ipixvc22","_id":"cjghqq7wj000fq8w8d5mk434v"},{"post_id":"cjghqq7w10002q8w8vixr69oj","tag_id":"cjghqq7wh000cq8w86gosjkmy","_id":"cjghqq7wj000gq8w84h9lg1sg"},{"post_id":"cjghqq7w70005q8w8sef531ah","tag_id":"cjghqq7wj000eq8w8855nl3m1","_id":"cjghqq7wo000lq8w87a2cergv"},{"post_id":"cjghqq7w70005q8w8sef531ah","tag_id":"cjghqq7wj000hq8w8n3sxq2ao","_id":"cjghqq7wo000mq8w8lgbm5e4a"},{"post_id":"cjghqq7w70005q8w8sef531ah","tag_id":"cjghqq7wh000cq8w86gosjkmy","_id":"cjghqq7wp000oq8w8543vbyep"},{"post_id":"cjghqq7w70005q8w8sef531ah","tag_id":"cjghqq7w40004q8w8dl55miu2","_id":"cjghqq7wp000pq8w8b8ee3dx3"},{"post_id":"cjghqq7wa0006q8w8owf59kwh","tag_id":"cjghqq7wd0008q8w8ipixvc22","_id":"cjghqq7wq000rq8w83nhcibop"},{"post_id":"cjghqq7wa0006q8w8owf59kwh","tag_id":"cjghqq7wh000cq8w86gosjkmy","_id":"cjghqq7wq000sq8w83qz4dr6b"},{"post_id":"cjghqq7wc0007q8w88fc5y8fx","tag_id":"cjghqq7wh000cq8w86gosjkmy","_id":"cjghqq7ws000wq8w8ymdxcvx3"},{"post_id":"cjghqq7wc0007q8w88fc5y8fx","tag_id":"cjghqq7wq000tq8w8yvrsy6mh","_id":"cjghqq7ws000xq8w83vf55hes"},{"post_id":"cjghqq7wc0007q8w88fc5y8fx","tag_id":"cjghqq7wr000uq8w8e639uif8","_id":"cjghqq7wt000zq8w869zol5py"},{"post_id":"cjghqq7we000aq8w8f8f2aub5","tag_id":"cjghqq7wr000vq8w8530rum1m","_id":"cjghqq7wt0011q8w8ullx3mpl"},{"post_id":"cjghqq7we000aq8w8f8f2aub5","tag_id":"cjghqq7ws000yq8w87cxqqr83","_id":"cjghqq7wu0012q8w8gu13g9r0"},{"post_id":"cjghqq7wh000dq8w8mdxtp6o7","tag_id":"cjghqq7wt0010q8w8ew1bmn9t","_id":"cjghqq7wu0013q8w8nt4yeosy"},{"post_id":"cjghqq7wh000dq8w8mdxtp6o7","tag_id":"cjghqq7wh000cq8w86gosjkmy","_id":"cjghqq7wu0014q8w8kjovankt"},{"post_id":"cjguqd7eo0000q7wbgy53hbi3","tag_id":"cjghqq7wj000hq8w8n3sxq2ao","_id":"cjguqd7ex0002q7wbh9nrylle"},{"post_id":"cjguqd7eo0000q7wbgy53hbi3","tag_id":"cjghqq7wj000eq8w8855nl3m1","_id":"cjguqd7ex0003q7wbx2evcdqq"},{"post_id":"cjguqd7eo0000q7wbgy53hbi3","tag_id":"cjguqd7es0001q7wb937okrab","_id":"cjguqd7ex0004q7wb7nvii3wf"}],"Tag":[{"name":"retrospective","_id":"cjghqq7w40004q8w8dl55miu2"},{"name":"devtools","_id":"cjghqq7wd0008q8w8ipixvc22"},{"name":"tips","_id":"cjghqq7wh000cq8w86gosjkmy"},{"name":"meetups","_id":"cjghqq7wj000eq8w8855nl3m1"},{"name":"community","_id":"cjghqq7wj000hq8w8n3sxq2ao"},{"name":"GitHub pages","_id":"cjghqq7wq000tq8w8yvrsy6mh"},{"name":"Cloudflare","_id":"cjghqq7wr000uq8w8e639uif8"},{"name":"burnout","_id":"cjghqq7wr000vq8w8530rum1m"},{"name":"mental health","_id":"cjghqq7ws000yq8w87cxqqr83"},{"name":"TIL","_id":"cjghqq7wt0010q8w8ew1bmn9t"},{"name":"speaking","_id":"cjguqd7es0001q7wb937okrab"}]}}
